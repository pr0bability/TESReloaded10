## What is New Vegas Reloaded?

New Vegas Reloaded is a custom graphical extender for Obsidian's "Fallout: New Vegas". It overrides the rendering pipeline to inject various effects that can be completely configured.

Started originally as part of the [TESReloaded](https://github.com/llde/TESReloaded10) project, it has now branched off into it's own project.

## Building from source
**Requirements**
* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/visualstudio2019community)
* [DirectX SDK 2009](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/directx-sdk)

**Building**

Run the `build.bat` file in command line, with the following command:

```shell
build.bat "NewVegasReloaded" "C:/DeployFolder/"
```

 * The second argument is optional, and can be used to copy the built library to the game folder or (preferably) to a mod folder managed by [Mod Organizer 2](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/mo2.html). Otherwise, the built files can be found in the `/build/` folder at the root, to be copied manually.
