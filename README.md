## What is New Vegas Reloaded?

New Vegas Reloaded is a custom graphical extender for Obsidian's "Fallout: New Vegas". It overrides the rendering pipeline to inject various effects that can be completely configured.

Started originally as part of the [TESReloaded](https://github.com/llde/TESReloaded10) project, it has now branched off into it's own project.
